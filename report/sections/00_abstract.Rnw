\begin{abstract}

In this report we assess the performance of publicly funded schools to determine the allocation of grant money for policymakers. Specifically, we attempt to identify the best schools in the US in terms of their demographic, academic, and socioeconomic characteristics in order to help increase equity and graduation rates for underserved populations. Additionally, we use predictive modeling techniques to find the determinants for graduation rates and post-graduation income. These include ridge regression, lasso regression, principal components regression, and partial least squares regression applied to data on US universities from College Scorecard provided by the US department of education. The best fitting model is then used to make accurate predictions on graduation and income. We find that coming from a low-income bracket family, having federal loans, and being a first-generation student has a strong negative relationship with income. On the other hand, cost of attendance and SAT scores heavily influence completion rates positively. Based on these factors, seven of the most urgent schools are selected for allocation of grant money.
